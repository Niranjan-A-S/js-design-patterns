/*
    However, there are downsides to invoking the methods directly on the manager instance. It could happen that we decide to rename certain methods later on, or the functionality of the methods change.

    Say that instead of calling it placeOrder, we now rename it to addOrder! This would mean that we would have to make sure that we donâ€™t call the placeOrder method anywhere in our codebase, which could be very tricky in larger applications. Instead, we want to decouple the methods from the manager object, and create separate command functions for each command!
